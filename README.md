## 📌 About This Repository

This repository contains my complete solutions and notes for the **Striver A2Z DSA Course/Sheet** by Striver (Take U Forward).

The goal of this repo is to:

* 📚 Master Data Structures & Algorithms from basics to advanced
* 💻 Write clean and optimized C++ solutions
* 🧠 Build strong problem-solving skills
* 🎯 Prepare for coding interviews & placements

---

## 🎯 Why Striver A2Z?

The **A2Z DSA Sheet** is structured in a progressive way:

* 🟢 Basics → Arrays, Recursion, Sorting
* 🔵 Intermediate → Linked List, Stack, Queue
* 🟣 Advanced → Trees, Graphs, DP
* 🔴 Expert → Segment Trees, Tries, Advanced DP

It ensures **concept clarity + pattern recognition**, which is key for cracking interviews.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Language: **C++**
* IDE: VS Code
* Compiler: g++
* Version Control: GitHub
